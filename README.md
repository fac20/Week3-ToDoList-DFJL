# Post-it, Do-it, Forget it :brain: 
In this project we've made a To Do List, focussing on developing our testing skills

## Process :hammer:
1. Crazy 8s - we each took 8 minutes to come up with 8 different ideas for types of To Do Lists
2. Refine - we highlighted features we liked
3. Discuss - we went back to the drawing board to figure out what our project was going to look like 
4. Wireframe - we used figma to sketch out a rough wireframe of our website (in mobile version).  
_Check out our sketches and wireframe [here](https://www.figma.com/file/qe3AHHHKjRjFoWprH2CuQH/Week3-TodoList?node-id=0%3A1)_
5. Kanban board - write up user stories and add issues for seperate tasks that needed to get done
6. Estimate - add E1, E2, E3 or E5 to estimate how long each task would take / how challenging they would be
7. Get to work ! We split up into pairs to get everything done, switching our pairs regularly so that everyone pair programmed with each other
8. Address code review issues
